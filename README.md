One day I decided that I am subscribed to too many Youtube channels. When I started going through my subscription list I quickly noticed the process is very time consuming because a user has to click each individual unsubscribe button. That's when I decided to look for a solution which would allow me to unsubscribe from multiple Youtube channels at once. I found a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48874382/how-to-unsubscribe-from-all-the-youtube-channels-at-once/48874466" target="_blank">forum post</a> and some articles (<a href="https://www.saintlad.com/mass-unsubscribe-youtube-channels-at-once/" target="_blank">here</a> is one of them) where a solution is presented, but it involves copying code into the browser's console and I thougth about making it easier for the average user. I then decided to look into the <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3">Youtube Data API</a> and quickly found out this wouldn't be that hard to do. So here's the finished product.

You will need to insert your own <b>apiKey</b> and <b>clientId</b> in the main.js file.
